# session-start.sh - SessionStart hook for claude-handoff plugin
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Generates and injects intelligent handoff context after /compact
#   by using claude --resume to analyze the previous session.
#
# HOOK EVENT: SessionStart (matcher: "compact")
#   - Fires when sessions start after compact operations
#   - Receives: session_id, transcript_path, cwd, source ("compact")
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#   - Checks for pending handoff state saved by pre-compact.sh
#   - Uses claude --resume to generate handoff prompt from previous session
#   - Injects generated handoff as additionalContext for new session
#   - Cleans up state file after successful generation
#
# TESTING:
#   1. Debug logging is enabled (see LOG_FILE below)
#   2. Run /compact after some work
#   3. Check logs:
#        tail -f /tmp/handoff-sessionstart.log
#   4. Verify handoff appears in new session
#   5. Check state file cleaned up:
#        ls -la .git/handoff-pending/  # should not exist
#
# MANUAL TESTING WITH FAKE STATE:
#   # Create fake state
#   mkdir -p .git/handoff-pending
#   echo '{"previous_session":"SESSION_ID","trigger":"manual","cwd":"'$(pwd)'"}' > .git/handoff-pending/handoff-context.json
#
#   # Run hook (replace SESSION_ID with a real session from ~/.claude/projects/*/transcript.jsonl)
#   echo '{"cwd":"'$(pwd)'","source":"compact"}' | bash session-start.sh
#
#   # Check output should contain additionalContext with handoff
#   # Cleanup
#   rm -rf .git/handoff-pending
#
# EXIT BEHAVIOR:
#   - Returns JSON with additionalContext if handoff generated
#   - Exits silently (exit 0, no output) if no handoff or generation fails

Pay special attention to context that may have been lost in compaction.

Analyze this conversation and create a focused handoff prompt for the next session.

Include:
1. **What we were working on** - Current task/goal
2. **Key decisions made** - Important choices or approaches agreed upon
3. **Relevant files** - Paths to files read/modified (paths only, no content)
4. **Next steps** - What should happen next
5. **Blockers** - Any errors, issues, or open questions

Format as concise markdown. Be specific and actionable. Omit meta-discussion about creating this handoff.

Ensure the user knows this was a result of the Claude-Handoff plugin system.
